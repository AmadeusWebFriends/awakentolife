## Children's rights

Children have their entitlements granted by the constitution and the UNCRC. A study conducted by interns in 2021<sup>1</sup> revealed that more than 55 percent of parents were not aware of what to do if there was a violation of children's rights. The survey results are [shown here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XjQKx6-UuONtnYzMLvT5tnhWbOsyeSph/view?usp=drive_link) and as a key step to create awareness, I have designed Child Rights sessions for teachers, school heads, parents and members of civil society.

## Children's education

Developmentally appropriate education that aligns with a growing child's psychological characteristics is the winning way to have a higher learning curve for children. Several educational philosophers have averred the need for providing relevant contextual education with necessary skills that aid development of the human potential. I have focused my efforts in studying and spreading Montessori education as a powerful builder of social capital. Teacher workshops on subjects and child development, School Leadership courses, School rating and assessments via the Child Rights Compliance Index Tool, parental role in child education are some of the sessions I offer.

## Women's rights and safety

Percentage of women entering the workforce has jumped by over 60 percent and society needs to wake up to enabling their lives that could potentially contribute substantially to the GDP. Women too need to know of their rights and responsibilities while safeguarding and asserting their boundaries in the workplace. POSH, Workplace conduct, time management in parenting, stress free conscious parenting,  legal protection clauses for women are some of the sessions I offer.

## Environment

Waste segregation, composting, recycling, repurposing, reducing and upcycling, minimalism, consumer behaviour and awareness are some of the important causes I support and proactively engage with public and communities to make living areas safe, clean and role modelled for children.

## Feminine hygiene

This is a cause that is hardly spoken about and has remained a taboo until groups of women began speaking out about the need for hygienic washrooms and sanitary hygiene machines that will ease their working conditions. Colleges and schools still remain a problem where girls either take off on those days, suffer in silence or are forced to go home if they get their periods. A society that cares to make living and study place conditions comfortable for girls and women is a progressive one and I am attempting to increase awareness about this cause through various support activities.

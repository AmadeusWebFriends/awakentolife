IF
you are managing a kitchen, cooking and all, 
you are a great cook
there is no clutter in your house
your bath and toilet areas are clean, well, most of the time 
you dont have a dusty showcase and reeking lofts
you have a fulfilling career that makes you a nice person to be with everyday, 
you are not an enemy to your kids and family then.... 
Welcome yourself to the exclusive club of Nearly Non-existent People- THE WORLD OF SUPER HUMANS!!

Its a huge effort to keep your door closed to insults and backlashes. Especially when it comes 
from loved ones. Its even more to forget it the next day and start off the relationship 
genuinely as though nothing happened  But its possible, just enjoy the aftermath. - feeling relaxed.

Why cant there just be pleasantness in this world? Just plain Adult to Adult conversation 
and no critical parent to child. Children love objective and fun filled communication. 
All critical parents need to think about why their missiles are always ducked - and never reach the target. 
If it does reach, then its just gathering momentum to return like a boomerang!

Marriage before 1990s - Responsibilities before Rights, tolerance and patience defined familial relationships.
Marriage after that - Rights before Responsibilities, speed, self centricity and one- up- ness seem to crack up humanity, let alone spousal relationships.  What went wrong? Everything.....  Dismayed at the growing separation rates.  These people are lazy even at that! separated by consent, not divorced (on marital status in a young techie s application form).
If people throw insults at you, just duck. If its from those you love, 
hold a warm gentle smile. If it is from people who you don't need to love, 
turn the other way and pat your feat!

Humility is not low self esteem, and vanity is not self confidence. It takes openness and wisdom to know the difference. 
Each of us have strengths and want others to acknowledge it, why do we fail to see it in others?.

Self cooking is the best cooking! Since the mood and attitude of the cook determines or affects your health! 
Beware those with cooks at home, or those eating outside. Map the cause rather than symptoms -VS Kitchen thoughts

If you have a mission in life and then decide to marry, heh! think a hundred times, 
but if you are married and now you want to have a mission, heh! dont think at all

If someone says "....because of fate" I choose to stay away from their influence, unless they are willing to listen 'otherwise'

Speak only if you can better silence. Its good to be constantly conscious of this fact. 
Micro and macro problems could be resolved automatically then

A Guru is one who inspires and spurs you to elevate yourself. 
A Guru may not be a physical form, but an insight that creates a mind field. 
A Guru will appear when a student is ready. 
Are you a student, awaiting a climb?

When some doors close, others open - true
If I keep hoping for the closed ones to open
between life's "wise cracks" I would fall through!

I have attained the highest standard of living when I can perform all the tasks I need for survival without depending on anyone!.

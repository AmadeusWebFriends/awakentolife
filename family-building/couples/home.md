## Sakhi: A pre-marital guide to relationships and parenting

This book is a compilation of articles and ideas towards preparing youth for an informed healthy married life and parenthood, stemming from my years of experience with children, youth, parents and educators.

It covers aspects of legal, social, physical, mental, financial, emotional, and spiritual preparation that gives confidence and deeper understanding before deciding on the marital path.

Ideally a handbook to be savoured by every youth to be more conscious and aware of responsibilities as well as rights, that come with the nuptial arrangement.

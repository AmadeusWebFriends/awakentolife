Orphanages are an outdated mode of caregiving for a developing country. The family support system to make it work should be the goal, as spelt out in the law. Supporting poverty stricken and disabled families to care for children is the task of a welfare state, and institutionalising should be the last resort, as per the Juvenile Justice Act , 2015. 

The options on finding abandoned or exploited children are

* &bull; to approach the Child Welfare Committee and present the child and whoever is having him to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC)

The CWC will institute the process of proper enquiry and find a way to restore the child to the family. If the child has no living parents or guardians, then after adequate checks, the child will be sent in for adoption or fostercare. Special needs children in very poor families are difficult to maintain, and Govt runs hostels for them where children can still have contact with the family.

When there is such a family that cannot take care of the child, reasons will be examined and a final supervised family based supportive care will be provided with perhaps a short term institutional one. This information needs to percolate among the public to stop funding meals in orphanages as children get over fed and do not realise the value of home-food and optimising spends.

The dangers of staff abusing children is also rampant and the parents hardly get to know this information or even if they do, they cannot act on it as they would have gotten dependent on the institution for caring for their child. Later on when children grow up, they hardly respect their family " you never cared for me when I was young, why do you bother about my life now? You want me to earn and support you, that is why?"

Such hurtful statements can be expected from the just adult turned children. In summary, it is better to locate a Govt school or college and support the living expenses, mentor and provide lifeskills to children, rather than supporting children in private orphanages. Government children's homes need support and inter-sectoral partnerships are possible to improve the quality of facilities and care in them as they serve the most neediest of the needy..

03	Relief Foundation history	Vidya Shankar's initiative to promote micro schools in rural Tamil Nadu to provide free education to neglected children is the culmination of 15 years of work with children. Her love for children led her to adopt her second child in 1992 and together with her husband, she started the Adoptive Families Association in 1995 to aid, advise and prepare adults for adoption. "Shortly after that I began investigating the existence of a large number of orphanages and started to research underprivileged children and their problems. This prompted me to set up the Relief Foundation in 1998 together with two other adoptive parents &mdash; family friend R. Kumar and her brother C.V. Vinod &mdash; and we began to work for rehabilitation of children in juvenile and observation homes in Chennai," she recalls.	http://www.educationworldonline.net/index.php/page-article-choice-more-id-2618

From 2001-2005, she held important portfolios within the government, as a chairperson of the juvenile welfare board, Chennai, and member magistrate of the juvenile justice board.

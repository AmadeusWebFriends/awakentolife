## Environment waste management:
Considering the number of laws and regulations that are already in place, it is still a sad state that unsegregated garbage is dumped in landfills in our country, more than 99 percent of the time. Where does one bring a change? Individual action that stirs societal consciousness. Solid waste management in individual households is possible with kits from Namma Ooru Foundation. (https://nammaooru.org/). 
Factories, offices, residential apartment complexes, shopping malls and hospitals can obtain efficient equipment to enable green practices in their campuses.
If you are interested to know more on how this can be done, please reach out with your details to : vidya@awakentolife.org.

Garbage dumping in Tamil Nadu is a significant problem, with the state generating over 15,000 tonnes of waste daily and processing only a fraction of it, leading to thousands of tonnes ending up in landfills or open spaces daily. The problem gets compounded with disease and health hazards of those handling the toxic wastes, including children, women and cattle. The time to act is now, get to know more about what and how this can be started individually as well as collectively.

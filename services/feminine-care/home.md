## Not a taboo anymore!

[Supreme Court insistense on basic hygiene - see clipping of 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G98Clok2LXBeYBNtOVkO-SaftTKgAJ4U/view?usp=drive_linkBTNINFO)

Women have begun to talk openly about the need for clean and hygienic washrooms with facilities for accessing sanitary napkins as well as disposing them, as vitally necessary for school children, college students and staff working in all kinds of workspaces. Personally having studied in a nearly all men college (Engineering during early 1980s) the few girls had to always rush home or to the hostel for changing napkins and it was a traumatic time being singled out and heckled by boys during those times.
As Supreme court guidelines now clearly prevail on the need for installing machines in every public space where girls and women frequent, inorder to make their lives easy and perform without stress.

## Need analysis

There is a clear drop out of girl students from Govt schools after the onset of puberty, due to the absence of hygienic washroom facilities and sanitary pad disposals. Factory women workers too face this issue and they mostly grit and bear the torment of having to change without a way to dispose. The need for sanitary vending and incinerator machines in all these places is becoming a topic of conversation especially with women entering the workforce in large numbers.

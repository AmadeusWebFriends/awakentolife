## Montessori enrichment programs

* Have you felt the need to empower yourself with more information on your tasks and deeper understanding of education itself? Whatever be your role in the education sector, it powerfully influences a child's life.
* If you are interested to know more , please reach out with details about your school/learning centre.

## Need Analysis

* That education needs a renewed approach is a non-debatable widely accepted statement by educators today. However the support system to bring out the best from within well meaning teachers and educators seems to be missing. This has resulted in a lack of understanding of the scientific advancement of brain research and incorporating the findings into the education system.
* Instead there is dumbing down with textbooks and standardised testing. The stage is set for education and policy makers to revisit the objectives of schooling children. The idea of education alienated from life seems to elude children who also grow up to be fractured in thought and spirit.
* When World War took it's toll, philosophers from all over the world conferred on this one topic - Education alone holds the key to change the crisis situation in the world.
* An experienced group of Montessori and High school educators who follow experiential learning are available with us to help, guide and mentor the programs of your school, with impact analysis and child rights compliance advice and assessment.

## Need Analysis

* CSR spending and Business Responsibility Reporting are important compliances for Corporates today, not because of the mandate, but the larger perspective of contemporary relevance of their activities in the field and global contribution to wellbeing.
* Most of the staff team members would have come right in after their qualifying degrees with significantly less life experiences, leave alone experiences of issues shackling underserved communities.
* Our 24 year traversing of the Social Work journey certainly endows our team with first hand knowledge on the need and impact of well designed programs that draws on local resources to establish sustainability of operations, rather than depending on external source of funds forever.
* Be it healthcare, youth skilling, early childhood care and protection, women's rights, legal literacy, developmentally appropriate education across ages, child rights or safety of women in workplaces, our team has direct hands on experience to be able to offer a real time assessment of the need or the impact of the project itself.
